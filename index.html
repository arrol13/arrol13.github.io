  <h1>Arrol Pereira's Portal</h1>
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p> I’m a graduate student with B.E degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from St Joseph Engineering College, Mangalore. My courses in Electrical, Electronics, Automation and Control Engineering Technologies have equipped me with a solid base upon which I plan to build my career.</p>
  <p>I interned at Karnataka Power Corporation Ltd. (KPCL), Bangalore which focused on Solar Energy for a period of 1 month. Overall, the internship at Karnataka Power Corporation Ltd. was an amazing opportunity, as I gained invaluable exposure into the world of day-to-day business operations.</p>
<p>Growth is my desire and I believe the opportunity to work in your esteemed organization will be an excellent opportunity. My academic experiences have greatly contributed to the development of my technical, teamwork, planning and time-management skills. I excel at communicating both clearly and professionally with co-workers, management and customers. With that being said, I strongly feel that my analytical skills, along with my passion for the Energy Industry, and smart-working mentality would make me a great addition to organization.</p>
